I have taken Introduction to Embedded Computing Systems as well as Computer Architetcure and Design. I have experience with C, 
C++, Java, Python and VHDL.

Interests:
I hope to further my knowledge of embedded systems and improve my skils coding in C. I am excited to work on designing and 
creating a game for my final project. I also hope to use my knowledge from this course to improve my capstone project as much
as possible.
