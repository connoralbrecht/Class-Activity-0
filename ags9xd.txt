Alexander Sarris (ags9xd)

Background: 
When an undergraduate, I took ECE 3430 (Intro to Embedded), SYS 2048 and 3048 (Intro to
Electromechanical Systems, Integrated System Design), and MAE 4710 (Mechatronics). I have 
experience programming with Java, C, and Arduino (a mix of C and C++) languages, along with 
HTML/CSS with WordPress templates. Coding projects I have worked on include software for 
thermal imaging goggles, the projects from ECE 3430, a mini greenhouse project, line-following and 
beacon-following robots, a robotic arm for undergrad capstone, and website construction.

Interests:
I am very interested in learning more about cyber-physical systems and the Internet of Things. In 
this class, I am hoping to dramatically improve my knowledge of coding in C to more efficiently 
write programs for embedded processors. I also want to learn more about timers and interrupt / 
event handlers and how they work. In addition, I am really hoping to become better at using 
Github, as this class will be the first time that I have ever used it for anything besides a reference 
for some of my side Arduino projects.
